# Singularity-CI

This is an entrypoint to show you how you can build Singularity containers 
on different Continuous Integration Services. This link was originally serving just
an example with travis-ci, and now will be updated to include more than that.


| Service | Status | Github |
|---------|--------|--------|
|[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularityhub/travis-ci.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularityhub/travis-ci) | [singularityhub/travis-ci](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/travis-ci) |


For each of the above, you should find complete instructions in the corresponding README.md
provided in the Github repositories. Build away, friends!
