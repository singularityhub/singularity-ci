# Singularity-CI Builders

This is an entrypoint to show you how you can build Singularity containers 
on different Continuous Integration Services. This link was originally serving just
an example with travis-ci, and now will be updated to include more than that.

| Service  | Status | Github |  |
|---------|--------|--------|--|
|[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularityhub/travis-ci.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularityhub/travis-ci) | [singularityhub/travis-ci](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/travis-ci) | ![img/sregistry-travis-small.png](img/sregistry-travis-small.png) |
|[CircleCI](https://www.circleci.com) |  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/singularityhub/circle-ci.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/singularityhub/circle-ci) | [singularityhub/circle-ci](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/circle-ci) | ![img/sregistry-circle-small.png](img/sregistry-circle-small.png) |

For the above, you should find complete instructions in the corresponding README.md
provided in the Github repositories. Build away, friends!
